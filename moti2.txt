Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Don't downgrade your dream just to fit your reality, upgrade your conviction to match your destiny.
You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.
You are confined only by the walls you build yourself.
The man who has confidence in himself gains the confidence of others
You attract what you are, not what you want. If you want great, then be great.
It's not who you are that holds you behind, it's who you think your are not.
Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and think of what could go right.
If you have the power to make someone happy, do it. The world needs more of that.
Always believe that something wonderful is about to happen.
Remember that life's greatest lessons are usually learned from worst times and from the worst mistakes.
Don't talk, just act. Don't say, just show. Don't promise, just prove.
Never stop doing great just because someone doesn't give you credit.
Discipline is doing what needs to be done, even if you don't want to.
If it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you.
Don't quit. You're already in pain. You're already hurt. Get a reward from it.
Be selective in your battles for sometimes peace is better than being right.
If we keep doing what we are doing, we're going to keep getting what we're getting.
